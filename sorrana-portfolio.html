        <h3>My Passion for AI and Web Development</h3>
        <P>10 July 2025</P>
        <p>AI and web development have interested me since I was young. Studying at Khon Kaen University has made me
          even more excited, because there are still so many things I want to learn, like image processing, signal
          processing, computer vision, and backend development. At first, it was quite challenging, especially when I
          was still getting used to university life. But in my second year, things got better, and I had more time to
          explore other topics, like hardware. I think it’s important to understand how computers work so I can help
          optimize product performance and learn even more.</p>

        <p>In the future, I hope to combine what I know about AI, web development, and hardware to create useful
          projects that help people in real life. I’m especially interested in using computer vision to make everyday
          tasks easier and in learning how to build systems that run faster and more efficiently. Besides technical
          skills, I also want to get better at teamwork and communication, because building great products isn’t just
          about coding — it’s about sharing ideas and working together. My goal is to keep learning and create things
          that can really make a difference.</p>
